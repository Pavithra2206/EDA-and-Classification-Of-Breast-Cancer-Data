# Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Of Breast Cancer Data
The statistical data visualization library Seaborn is used to discover and explore the relationships in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. 
EDA is conducted using visualizations to identify and interpret inherent relationships in the data set, produce various chart types including histograms, 
violin plots, box plots, joint plots, pair grids, and heatmaps, customize plot aesthetics and apply faceting methods to visualize higher dimensional data. 
A boosted decision tree classifier with XGBoost is built to classify tumors as either malignant or benign.
